dotfiles and other configuration files

Run the setup script (./setup) to create symlinks and fetch additional stuff:

- For ubuntu and OSX run it the first-time only
- For windows run it after every update, as symlinks aren't real on windows

For vim powerline to work correctly, the fonts in the fonts/ directory must
also be installed in an OS specific way.
