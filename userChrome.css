To hide the native tabs, you'll have to add a new file called userChrome.css and the css property visibility: collapse.

To do this, in Firefox click on Click on Menu -> Help -> Troubleshooting Information or navigate to about:support in the address bar.

Under the Application Basics section, there will be a section called Profile Directory with a button to Open Directory.

In the Profile Directory create a new folder called chrome. In the chrome folder create or edit the file userChrome.css if it already exists.


Finally, go to about:config and set toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets to true
